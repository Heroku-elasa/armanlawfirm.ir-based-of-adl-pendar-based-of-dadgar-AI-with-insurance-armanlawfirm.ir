Summarize the issue and suggest fixes for the following lint item: Title: Leaked Password Protection Disabled Entity: Auth Schema: N/A Issue Details: Supabase Auth prevents the use of compromised passwords by checking against HaveIBeenPwned.org. Enable this feature to enhance security. Description: Leaked password protection is currently disabled.




Reasoned
Summary of the issue
Leaked Password Protection Disabled — Supabase Auth currently has the leaked/compromised password protection turned off. This feature checks user-supplied passwords against the Have I Been Pwned (HIBP) breach database and blocks passwords that appear in known leaks. With it disabled, users may be able to register or reset accounts using passwords that are known-compromised, increasing the risk of account takeover.

Why this matters
Compromised passwords are easy targets for attackers using credential stuffing.
Blocking known-breached passwords reduces successful account takeovers and improves your overall security posture and compliance posture.
It’s a low-friction control: it doesn’t require changing your authentication flows, only toggling a setting.
Suggested fixes (priority and steps)
Enable leaked password protection in Supabase Auth (recommended — quick, high impact)

Open your Supabase project dashboard → Auth settings → “Security” (or similar section).
Toggle Leaked Password Protection / Compromised Password Check to ON.
Save changes and test sign-up and password reset flows to confirm no regressions.
(Optional but recommended) Configure block/allow behavior and messaging

Decide whether to block leaked passwords outright or warn users and require a stronger password. Blocking is most secure.
Update UI messages shown to users so they get a clear, friendly explanation (e.g., “This password appears in a data breach. Please choose a different password.”).
Ensure the client properly surfaces server error messages returned from the Auth API and doesn't leak internal details.
Add server-side password strength policy (complementary)

Enforce minimum length and complexity on the server (Auth provider or via custom logic) so that even non-breached but weak passwords are discouraged.
Example rules: minimum 12 characters for user accounts, disallow common patterns, require a mix of classes (or use passphrase guidance).
Monitor and alert on blocked attempts

Log or track rejected sign-up/reset attempts due to leaked-password checks so you can monitor user friction and detect potential attack spikes (credential stuffing attempts).
Communicate to users and support staff

Update help docs/FAQ and support scripts so support staff can explain why a password was rejected and how to choose a safer one.
Validation and testing
After enabling, perform:
A signup using a known breached password (e.g., one from HIBP test vectors) — it should be rejected.
A normal signup/reset with a safe password — it should work unchanged.
Confirm error messages are user-friendly and not leaking internal info.
If you cannot enable via dashboard
If you don’t see the option in the dashboard (e.g., due to plan restrictions or UI changes):

Search the Supabase docs for “leaked password protection” or “Have I Been Pwned” settings — I can run that search for you and provide exact steps.
Alternatively, implement a server-side check against HIBP (k-Anonymity API) in your auth flow as a fallback (I can provide sample code if you want).
If you’d like, I can (a) walk you through the exact dashboard steps for your current Supabase version, (b) search the Supabase docs for the latest guide and link steps, or (c) provide sample server-side code to check passwords against HIBP. Which would you prefer?
