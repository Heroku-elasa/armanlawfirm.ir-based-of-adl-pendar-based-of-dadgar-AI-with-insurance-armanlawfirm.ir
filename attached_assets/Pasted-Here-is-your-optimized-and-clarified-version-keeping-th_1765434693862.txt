Here is your **optimized and clarified version**, keeping the structure and purpose while adding the new requirement about an **Admin Dashboard for AI API Management** — without changing the technical meaning.

I only refine and restructure the prompt.

# **Optimized Prompt (with Admin AI Dashboard Requirement Added)**

## **PROMPT: Implement a Multi-Provider AI Fallback System and AI API Management Dashboard**

## **OBJECTIVE**

Upgrade all AI-powered features in the project by adding:

1. **A multi-provider fallback system** that automatically switches between AI providers when one fails.
2. **An AI API Management Dashboard** inside the website’s admin panel (e.g., WordPress dashboard or equivalent), allowing administrators to:

   * View all configured AI providers
   * Add or remove API keys
   * See API usage limits and quotas
   * Enable/disable providers
   * Adjust provider priority order
   * Debug AI-related functions and error logs

This prompt must apply to **any AI-generated website**.

---

## **PROVIDER ORDER (Fallback Chain)**

1. **Primary Provider** – e.g., `gemini-2.5-flash`
2. **Secondary Provider (via OpenRouter)** – e.g., `google/gemini-2.0-flash-001`
3. **Cloudflare Workers AI** – e.g., `@cf/meta/llama-3.2-3b-instruct`
4. **OpenAI** – e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`

*The system should allow reordering or replacing these through the admin dashboard.*

---

## **REQUIRED ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES**

The prompt must ensure the following environment variables (or similar) are set:

* `GEMINI_API_KEY`
* `OPENROUTER_API_KEY`
* `CLOUDFLARE_ACCOUNT_ID`
* `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN`
* `OPENAI_API_KEY`

These should be manageable through the Admin AI Dashboard when possible.

---

## **IMPLEMENTATION STEPS**

### **Step 1: Add Shared Types and Interfaces**

Add the unified provider interfaces to the main AI service file:

```ts
interface AIProvider {
  name: string;
  call: (
    prompt: string,
    maxTokens: number,
    temperature: number
  ) => Promise<string>;
}

interface FallbackConfig {
  maxTokens: number;
  temperature: number;
  providers?: AIProvider[];
}
```

---

### **Step 2: Add Admin AI Dashboard (WordPress or any admin panel)**

The dashboard should include:

* Provider list and configuration
* API key input fields
* Usage / limit displays
* Logs for AI errors
* Buttons to reorder providers
* Toggle switches to enable/disable providers
* Diagnostic tools for debugging AI functions

If you want, I can also:
✅ compress the prompt
✅ convert it into a Replit AI command
✅ turn it into a system-level instruction
Just tell me!
